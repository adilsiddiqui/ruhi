				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					Surbhi is an effort by a team of happy and efficient people including many associates present since the day ‘One’ and its founders and their kids now. It is a business started and run by three very typical Indian families of the 21st with traditional values and a contemporary mindset. It is co-founded by Mr. Trilokchand Agrawal, Mr. Pradeep Jain and Mr. Kailash Gupta; all belonging to the lineage of restaurateurs and caterers and halwais’ since seven decades. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Our Goregaon West store is our flagship store, this is where Surbhi was born. It is where one of our grandfather’s was running a restaurant since 1942; as an effort to catch up with the changing time, the concept of ‘Surbhi’ was formed where the three families came together as partners since year 2000. Since then it is a cumulative effort of all the 
					generations wherein all have contributed their treasured experience and continue to do so. Our grandfathers’ passed on their prized recipes and expertise to our fathers’ ; our fathers’ brought in change andexpansion and now its us the ‘third’ generation of Surbhi bringing in the needed Standardization and Technology.

					The samosas’, the vada’s are not just fried in a heated oil of kadhai any more. We use fry powder that 
					reduces carbon formation in the oil and they are fried in a pan set with timer to maintain uniformity. 
					There are many such nuances we have brought in place so that all our esteemed customers enjoy same taste when you eat anything from any of our stores. Surbhi was formed on the basis of very strong ethics of ‘Serve Only Good Quality’ and that is one of the main reasons why; we have expanded cautiously and not 
					aggressively to master the management of this chain and create a brand with only and only mouth publicity. The name ‘Surbhi’ has now earned its title as a brand only because of our loyal esteemed patrons and our 
					every effort of providing superior and consistent quality.
					<br><br>
					We as a team of ‘Surbhi’ now feel ready to integrate our brand with more added value and expansion. 
					We do plan on coming up with more exciting products and exclusive stores around the city localizing with the demographics of the area. As we always believe in focusing on our bestsellers and 
					mastering what our customer’s enjoy most.
